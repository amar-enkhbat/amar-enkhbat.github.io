        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>Amar Enkhbat</h2>
        <p>Amar Enkhbat was born in Mongolia in 1993. He came to Japan in 2012 to study robotics and artificial intelligence. <br>
          Currently, he's a 4th year student at Kochi University, Japan. <br>
          <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
          <p>Amar is fluent in English, Japanese and Mongolian. He has great deal of respect for different countries and cultures and loves to know more about them. At the moment, he is having fun studying Swedish and Russian. <br>
          He absolutely loves technology and believes that humanity can be the best species in the universe using technology. Ever since he was a kid, he loved tinkering with clocks and loved building things by himself. Since the unveiling of ASIMO in 2000, he found his true passion: AI and Robots. Ever since then he has been working non-stop to create a robot indistuingishable from humans.<br>
          He also loves nature. Usually when he's not staring at a whiteboard full of mathematical equations or reading documentation on the internet, he's usually found in the woods, in the mountains, nearby a lake wondering about the magnifecence of mother nature. <br>
          As much as he loves technology, he has a firm belief technology should not be used to harm nature. He recycles every bottles, milk containers, batteries, plastic trays etc. 
        </p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>Amar believes that Neural Networks are the key to AGI (artificial general intelligence) and has dedicated himself on learning every bit of theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning. </p>
        <p>At the moment, he's writing a paper on detecting and recognizing an action from a brainwave data.</p>
        <p>Also, he thinks that current neural networks are in their infancy and needs a lot of work to properly "learn" and we should apply biological learning ideas to Neural Networks</p>
