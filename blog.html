        <h1>Time to update my website</h1>
        <p>Let me be honest, this website, its looks, functions and colors are utter shite. It's time to upgrade this site with some JavaScript magic. It's gonna take some time though. My knowledge on JavaScript is terrible at the moment but it's still climbing. This month, this website will turn into something more aesthetically pleasing and proper.</p>
        <p>Also I'm adding my Signate data science competition source code to GitHub.</p>
        <h1>Prototype website</h1>
        <p>Launched my own personal website. As I was working on projects, I realized that I needed a place where everything was connected and easier for others to see what I've been up to. This is a temporary website (yeah because it looks like it was made in 2002) built using my beginner html and css skills. After sinking my teeth into web development (codeacademy), I'll publish a proper modern website. At the moment this will probably work just fine. 
        </p>
        <p>On another note,</p>
        <p>I realized I wasn't really a programmer after watching this video.</p>

        <p>As much as I like programming, I realized that I'm more into the mathematics behind machine learning. I often find myself staring at a whiteboard with math gibberish on it rather than looking up codes on stackoverflow. <br>
        Lately, I've found out that studying machine learning, especially neural networks, is like studying my own self. It's a field where you ask yourself "Given that situation what would my decision process would be?" a lot. It's like studying my own brain using math then simulating it through computers.</p>
        <p>Maybe that's why computational neuroscience has been intriguing me lately more than stackoverflow.</p>
