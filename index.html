        <h1>More about me</h1>
          <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p>Amar Enkhbat was born in Mongolia in 1993. He came to Japan in 2012 to study robotics and artificial intelligence through Japanese government sponsored scholarship programme. <br>
        
          <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
            <p>Amar is fluent in English, Japanese and Mongolian. He has great deal of respect for different countries and cultures and loves to know more about them. At the moment, he is having fun studying Russian and Swedish. <br>
            He absolutely loves technology and believes that humanity can be only improved through technology. Ever since he was a kid, he loved tinkering with clocks and loved building small devices by himself. Since the unveiling of ASIMO in 2000, he found his true passion: AI and Robots. Ever since then he has been working non-stop to create a robot indistuingishable from humans.<br>
            He also loves nature. Usually when he's not staring at a whiteboard full of mathematical equations or reading library documentations on the internet, he's usually found in woods, on mountains, nearby a lake enjoying the magnificence of mother nature. <br>
            As much as he loves technology, he has a firm belief that technology that harms nature is redundant. 
            </p>
            <p>On his free time he tries data science competitions. However, he leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>At the moment, he's writing a paper on detecting and recognizing an motor movement imagery from a brainwave data using Deep Neural Networks.</p>
